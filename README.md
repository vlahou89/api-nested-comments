# Live Demo

# Methodology Used

- This React application has been created in order to display comments and replies (inc nested replies)
  from an API.

- The data fetching achieved by using axios and useEffect hook.

- Next, we had to map through the array with data and display the main comments and users.

- In order to get and display the nested comments, a recursive function has been used.

- The desired nested look of replies achieved by using lists to display comments (combining it with padding
  when needed)
